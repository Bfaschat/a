# Telegram-UserBot 

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/baalajimaestro/telegram-userbot/branches/modular/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/baalajimaestro/telegram-userbot)

### If you see the semaphore badge showing passed, still running on your local PC gives syntax it must be very clear that it isn't a problem with the source, you need to check your compiler



Just coz I'm too lazy, I program it, to make stuff easier.
This is a userbot, which is equivalent to a telegram client, and it can run on the cloud too.
It needs a linux pc or any unix to run basic commands, or you need to find the workaround yourself :/

## Dependencies:

- SQL DB, Can be Postgres/MySQL or anything, basically the bot uses SQLAlchemy

- Neofetch(in case you need sysdetails)

### Before you start:
Get your api-id(API_KEY in my code), API_HASH from my.telegram.org.<br/><br>
Create an empty group, add marie, or any of its clone, find group id, then copy it and this is your LOGGER(Incase you want logging) It can be very well turned off<br/><br/>
**Please read through this before cloning. I don't want you get stuck anywhere. This guide can get you running up the userbot, if followed properly**

#### Running on heroku:
```diff
-If you clone/fork this repo please make sure you generate a session file  by running app.py on your local pc before deploying it on heroku.
```

- Fork my repo.

- Download/Clone it in your linux PC, then follow instructions on Running on linux(below), this will generate a userbot.session file, which is needed to run your bot.

- Push it with the heroku cli

- Deploy.
